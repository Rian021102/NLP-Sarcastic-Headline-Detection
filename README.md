# Supervised Learning for Sarcasm Detection in Headlines: An NLP Approach
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages. It involves developing algorithms and systems that can analyze, understand, and generate human language, enabling computers to communicate with humans in a more natural and intuitive way. NLP techniques are used in a wide range of applications, including language translation, text summarization, dialogue systems, and sentiment analysis.

In addition, with the rise of popularity of ChatGPT has sparked a newly found interest of many Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer. It opens up many possibility of how NLP approach can be utilized to develop many Machine Learning application based on NLP.

In this study case, I develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify sarcastic headlines in a given dataset, using natural language processing techniques and supervised learning."

This objective clearly states the goal of the project and specifies the methods that will be used to achieve it. It is important to have a clear and specific objective in order to focus the efforts of the project and measure the success of the model
